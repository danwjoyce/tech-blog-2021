abstract: "Accessing specialist secondary mental health care in the NHS in England requires a referral, usually from primary or acute care. Community mental health teams triage these referrals deciding on the most appropriate team to meet patients’ needs. Referrals require resource-intensive review by clinicians and often, collation and review of the patient’s history with services captured in their electronic health records (EHR). Triage processes are, however, opaque and often result in patients not receiving appropriate and timely access to care that is a particular concern for some minority and under-represented groups. Our project, funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) will develop a clinical decision support tool (CDST) to deliver accurate, explainable and justified triage recommendations to assist clinicians and expedite access to secondary mental health care"
