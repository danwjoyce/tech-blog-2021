abstract: "Artificial intelligence (AI) can help clinicians to improve healthcare decision-making by integrating data from high-volume, heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs). However, there is growing evidence that AI solutions in healthcare carry considerable risk of harm for people belonging to racial, ethnic, sexual and gender minority communities, which can exacerbate inequalities."
