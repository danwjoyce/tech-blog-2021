bio: Iâ€™m interested in how principles from computation can be used to understand things like clinical state, trajectories and how to augment clinical decision making using data, multivariate statistics and (cautiously) AI and ML.

I am a consultant psychiatrist and Professor of Connected Mental Health at the Institute of Population Health, University of Liverpool, where I work on using data to better inform how treatments and interventions can be targeted to, or made more effective for, individuals.  I am particularly interested in methods for delivering "actionable data" -- for example, modeling clinical state and trajectories -- that directly informs interventions/management and how to use this data build decision support tools.  This work draws on principles from computation, applied multivariate statistics and artificial intelligence / machine learning.  While I'm generally optimistic about the potential of these approaches, I'm more cautious about the current AI/ML hype.
