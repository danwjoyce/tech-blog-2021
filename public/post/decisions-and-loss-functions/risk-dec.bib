These results have led several recent JAMA Psychiatry articles to conclude that nonclinical interventions must be central components in any successful multimodal SRB prevention strategy. I agree. But I disagree with the pessimism about components of this strategy in 2 of these recent articles: an editorial by Hoge about the low value of existing SRB-focused clinical trials and an article by Belsher et al about the low value of machine-learning (ML) methods.}",
